user can pass info with:
1. full url
2. username & reponame
3. by copy-pasting the git url (eg,: https://github.com/jpmonette/feed.git)


find out how to poll/watch the feed

once something new has happened, use a parser to extract 
relevant info & call the notification library

display the notification with the info

once displayed, save the lastest commit hash, date, and other stuff? to a JSON file

on startup
option 1: find out how many notifications were missed and display that as a notification
option 2: silently find out how farr behind we are, but only display new notifications (no info about ones we've missed)
